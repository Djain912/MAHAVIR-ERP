invoiceNumber: {
  type: String,
  trim: true
},

  trim: true
},

### **Backend Integration**

- **Controller**: Automatically saves invoice, outlet, salesman data
- **Storage**: Stored in CashCollection document for future reference

### **Use Cases**:

3. **Salesman Name**: Track who handled the sale (driver or helper)

## 2. 💸 **Daily Expense Tracking**

### **Database Schema Updates**
**File**: `backend/src/models/CashCollection.js`

Added expense fields:
```javascript
dailyExpenseAmount: {
  type: Number,
  default: 0,
  min: [0, 'Daily expense cannot be negative']
},
expenseNotes: {
  type: String,
  maxlength: [500, 'Expense notes cannot exceed 500 characters']
}
```

### **Driver App UI**

**Features**:
- Yellow highlight box shows total expense when amount > 0
- Character counter (500 char limit)
- Example placeholder: "Fuel ₹500, Food ₹200"
- Visible summary in confirmation dialog

### **Backend Integration**
- Stored with each cash collection
- Can be analyzed for expense patterns
- Available for future reporting/analytics

### **Use Cases**:
1. **Fuel Expenses**: ₹500 for diesel
2. **Food Expenses**: ₹200 for lunch
3. **Toll/Parking**: ₹150 for tolls
4. **Misc**: Any other daily expenses

**Example**:

## 3. 🚫 **Bill Cancellation Functionality**

### **Database Schema Updates**
**File**: `backend/src/models/CashCollection.js`

Added cancellation fields:
```javascript
isCancelled: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false
},
cancelledAt: {
  type: Date
},
cancelledBy: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User'
},
cancellationReason: {
  type: String,
  maxlength: [500, 'Cancellation reason cannot exceed 500 characters']
},
cancelledAmount: {
  type: Number,
  default: 0
}
```

### **Backend Services**
**File**: `backend/src/services/cashCollectionService.js`

**New Methods**:

1. **`cancelBill(collectionId, cancelledBy, cancellationReason)`**
   - Marks bill as cancelled
   - Records who cancelled it and when
   - Stores cancelled amount
   - Returns stock to inventory (TODO: future implementation)
   - Prevents cancellation of reconciled bills

2. **`getCancelledBills(filters)`**
   - Retrieves all cancelled bills
   - Supports filtering by driver, date range
   - Pagination support

### **API Endpoints**
**File**: `backend/src/routes/cashCollectionRoutes.js`

New routes:
```javascript
// Cancel a bill
PATCH /api/cash-collections/:id/cancel
Authorization: Admin, Supervisor, Driver
Body: { cancellationReason: "Wrong amount entered" }

// Get cancelled bills
GET /api/cash-collections/cancelled/list
Authorization: Admin, Supervisor, Driver
Query: driverId, startDate, endDate, page, limit
```

### **Permissions**:
- ✅ **Driver**: Can cancel their own unreconciled bills
- ✅ **Supervisor**: Can cancel any unreconciled bill
- ✅ **Admin**: Can cancel any unreconciled bill
- ❌ **Nobody**: Cannot cancel reconciled bills (requires admin approval)

### **Business Logic**:
1. Bill can only be cancelled if not reconciled
2. Cancellation reason is mandatory
3. Cancelled amount is stored for audit
4. Stock should be returned to inventory (future feature)
5. Cancelled bills remain in history (soft delete)

### **Use Cases**:
1. **Wrong Amount**: Driver entered wrong collection amount
2. **Duplicate Entry**: Same collection entered twice
3. **Cancelled Sale**: Customer cancelled the order
4. **Data Error**: Incorrect products or quantities

## 4. 📊 **Data Structure for Future Use**

All new fields are designed to support future features:

### **Analytics & Reporting**
- **Invoice Number**: Track bill-wise sales, generate reports
- **Outlet Name**: Outlet-wise sales analysis
- **Salesman Name**: Performance tracking per salesman
- **Daily Expenses**: Expense trends, budget analysis

### **Future Modules**
- **Counter Sales Module**: Use outlet names for linking
- **Invoice Management**: Track and search by invoice number
- **Expense Reports**: Generate monthly expense summaries
- **Sales Analytics**: Analyze by outlet, salesman, time period

### **Data Relationships**
```
CashCollection
  ├── invoiceNumber → Links to future Invoice Module
  ├── outletName → Links to Retailer/Wholesaler
  ├── salesmanName → Links to Driver/User
  ├── dailyExpenseAmount → Links to Expense Module
  └── isCancelled → Links to Cancelled Bills Report
```
