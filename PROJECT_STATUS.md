## üìû SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Variance too high
**Solution:** Review denomination counts, check for missing cash, verify expected amount calculation

**Issue:** Driver can't submit collection
**Solution:** Check dispatch status (must be Active), verify driver authentication, check network connectivity

**Issue:** Wholesaler not showing in list
**Solution:** Verify wholesaler is marked as active, check filters applied

### Monitoring Points
- Daily variance reports
- Unverified collections count
- Wholesaler credit limit alerts
- Driver submission compliance
