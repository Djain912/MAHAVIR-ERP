## 🔄 Salary Calculation Logic

### 1. Working Days Calculation
```
Working Days = Present Days + (Half Days × 0.5) + Paid Leave Days
```

### 2. Basic Amount Calculation
```
Per Day Salary = Basic Salary / Days in Month
Basic Amount = Per Day Salary × Working Days
```

### 3. Deductions
- **Absent Deduction**: `Per Day Salary × Absent Days`
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction**: `Per Day Salary × Unpaid Leave Days`
- **Advance Deduction**: `Min(Per Month Installment, Remaining Amount)`
- **Loan Deduction**: Manual entry
- **Late Fine**: Manual entry
- **Other**: Manual entry

### 4. Final Calculation
```
Gross Salary = Basic Amount + Commission + Bonus + Allowances + Overtime
Total Deductions = Sum of all deductions
Net Salary = Gross Salary - Total Deductions
```

## 💰 Advance Recovery System

### Recovery Plan
1. **Installments**: 1-12 months
2. **Per Month Deduction**: `Advance Amount / Installments`
3. **Start Month**: Next month after approval (auto-calculated)

### Auto-Recovery Process
1. When salary slip is generated:
   - Check for pending advances
   - Calculate deduction (min of installment or remaining amount)
   - Add to `advancePayments` array in salary slip
   - Update advance deduction in deductions

2. When salary is marked as paid:
   - Record recovery in advance document
   - Update `totalRecovered` and `remainingAmount`
   - Add entry to `recoveredMonths` array
   - Change status to 'Recovering' or 'Recovered'

### Example
- **Advance**: ₹12,000
- **Installments**: 3 months
- **Per Month**: ₹4,000
- **Month 1**: ₹4,000 deducted → Remaining ₹8,000
- **Month 2**: ₹4,000 deducted → Remaining ₹4,000
- **Month 3**: ₹4,000 deducted → Remaining ₹0 → Status: Recovered

## 📅 Leave Balance System

### Annual Leave Allocation
- **Sick Leave**: 12 days
- **Casual Leave**: 12 days
- **Paid Leave**: 15 days
- **Unpaid Leave**: Unlimited (but deducted from salary)

### Leave Impact on Salary
- **Paid Leaves**: Count as working days (no deduction)
- **Unpaid Leaves**: Deducted from salary (Per Day Salary × Days)
