# üì± Driver App Network Connection Guide

## Problem: "Network Error" when app tries to connect to backend

The driver app can't reach the backend server because of incorrect IP configuration.

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION** (Updated your IP automatically)

I've updated `.env` with your current IP: **`192.168.0.155`**

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Restart the Expo app** to load the new IP:
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal running Expo
   - Run `npm start` again
   
2. **Reload the app** on your device:
   - Shake your phone to open dev menu
   - Tap "Reload"
   
   OR in terminal press: `r` to reload

## üîç **Testing the Connection**

Once reloaded, the app should show:
```
LOG  üåê API URL: http://192.168.0.155:5000/api
```

Test the backend is accessible from your phone:
- Open browser on your phone
- Visit: `http://192.168.0.155:5000/api/health`
- You should see: `{"status":"OK","message":"Server is running"}`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **If IP Changes Later**

Your computer's IP may change if you:
- Restart your router
- Connect to different WiFi
- Restart your computer

### To fix it:

1. **Find your new IP:**
   ```powershell
   ipconfig | findstr "IPv4"
   ```
   Look for the one starting with `192.168.x.x`

2. **Update `.env` file:**
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_NEW_IP:5000/api
   ```

3. **Restart Expo and reload app**

---

## üîê **Firewall Check** (if still not working)

The backend needs to accept connections on port 5000:

1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall** ‚Üí Advanced Settings
2. Click **Inbound Rules** ‚Üí **New Rule**
3. Select **Port** ‚Üí Next
4. Enter **5000** ‚Üí Next
5. Allow the connection ‚Üí Next
6. Check all profiles ‚Üí Next
7. Name it "Backend API" ‚Üí Finish

## ‚úÖ **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] Backend server is running (you'll see it in terminal)
- [ ] `.env` has correct IP (`192.168.0.155`)
- [ ] Phone/emulator on same WiFi as computer
- [ ] Expo app restarted with new config
- [ ] App reloaded on device
